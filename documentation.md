What Now

1- Background 

  With the current world pandemic, more and more people are forced to stay indoors and while that seems to be a blessing at first 
people are running out of ideas on what to do indoors. With this website i look to offer people some new ideas to pass the time.

2- Wireframes

  I layed out my pages so that they would have a homepage, a submission form, a page for each theme and then a page for each idea.

3- GDPR

  In order to vomply with the GDPR regulations i created a privacy policy that explains how the website treats the users personal information.
  As for the Cookie Policy i used a online resource to create it because my JavaScript is limited and the policy is a must have.

4- Color choice

  I choose to use these colors because this is supposed to be a fun website.

5- Evaluation

  With this project i tried to provide a website where people can see ideas and also suggest new ideas allowing for the expansion of the website.
  
  It was challenging to get the element positioning right but after researching several online guides and the language documentation i found what i needed to do it like i wanted.

  For testing i used the Chrome responsive website function to correctly position the elements in the desktop and mobile websites

  My designs are based on the experience i have navigating the Internet. That is why i tried to make a simple to use and eye pleasing website.
